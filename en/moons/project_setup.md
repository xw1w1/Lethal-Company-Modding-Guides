# Project Setup

**Before reading this chapter, make sure you have already completed the [editor setup](https://github.com/xw1w1/Lethal-Company-Modding-Guides/blob/main/en/moons/setup.md).**

## Mod Manager
If you don't have `r2modman` installed yet, do so via the link: https://r2modman.com/download/

After opening the application, select `Lethal Company`, modify the standard modpack `Default`, or create a new one.

Go to the `Online` tab, find the mods `Lethal Level Loader`, `Lethal Lib` and download them. All required dependencies will be downloaded along with them.

After that, your modpack should look something like this:

Click on `Start modded`. You will need to launch the game and land on a planet so that the plugins can create all the necessary files.

After launching, go back to `r2modman`, click on the `Settings` tab at the bottom, and select the second item "`Browse profile folder`"

Once opened, copy everything that is inside the `BepInEx/plugins` folder. (I ended up with 8 folders)

Return to `Unity`. In `Projects`, navigate to an empty area in the `Assets` folder and right-click > `Show in explorer`

This will open the folder containing all your project files. Navigate to `Assets/LethalCompany/Mods/plugins` and paste all the folders you copied there. The project tree should look something like this:

## Potential Issues
If you encounter an issue of the following nature in the console:

Go to the `.../Mods/plugins` folder and uncheck the "`Validate References`" for `LethalLevelLoader.dll`.

Once the import is complete, `LethalLevelLoader` should appear in the context menu. If this doesn't happen, try restarting `Unity`, or repeat this step from the beginning, after clearing the `plugins` folder in your project first.
