# Tutorial on creating custom moons using LethalLevelLoader

This guide is relevant for game version v73, but as the game updates, guidelines will be updated asap.

## Preparation.
First, you need to install all the necessary components.

- `Git`: https://git-scm.com/install/ (for downloading your own Packages in Unity, etc.)

- `.NET 9`: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0

### Unity
After installing the required components, install `UnityHub`: https://unity.com/download

And `UnityEditor` version `2022.3.62f2`. https://unity.com/ru/releases/editor/archive


## Creating the project.
When creating a project, __make sure__ you are using version `2022.3.62f2` and the `High Definition 3D` template.

## Project setup.

In the opened project, go to the top toolbar and find `Window > Package Manager`.

In the top-left corner of the opened window, there should be a `+`. 

Click on it and select the option `Add package from git URL...`.

Paste the following links into the input field:

- https://github.com/Zaggy1024/unity-lc-project-patcher.git#v73-fixes

**⚠️ After downloading the packages, a restart of the editor may be needed if some UI elements are not visible. ⚠️** 

## Patching the game.

A new section called `Tools` should appear in the toolbar.

Go to it. Find `Unity Project Patcher > Open Window`.

Click `Install BepInEx` at the bottom of the window and wait for the download to complete.

### Note that a licensed copy of Lethal Company on Steam is required for game modifications.

Finally, open Steam, find Lethal Company in it, go to `Manage > Browse local files` and copy game folder path.

_Typically, it's something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company`._

Go down to the `Project` panel. Find the file `UPPatcherUserSettings` in the `Assets` folder and paste the path to the game in the appropriate field.

Return to the recently opened window and click `Run Patcher`.

### After that, the editor will restart automatically about 7–10 times, but from time to time it will show pop-up windows.

You just need to click "`Ok`" or "`Yes`", but be sure to read and make sure you understand what you are doing.

Congratulations, now you have a successfully patched Lethal Company project!
